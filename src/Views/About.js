      <p>Hey there! My name is Ellie and I am new to the software world. I come from the theater world were I was previously working
        as a stage manager. When my industry was shutdown in spring of 2020, I was completely lost on what I would do for work. I made the decision to
        signup for a 3 week bootcamp at the Nashville Software School in the fall of 2020, thinking it would just
        be something fun to learn during qurantine. Once I finished the bootcamp I was hooked! I applied for the year long
        evening cohort and I am now finishing up the frontend portion. I have learned so much in the past 6 months and I am
        truly thankful for the Nashville Software School. Take a look around my site and checkout some projects I have been
        working on. I am always looking for new connections, so send me an email and introduce yourself. I would love to meet you!
